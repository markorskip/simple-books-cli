# SimpleBooksCLI

The idea for this project is to build a book keeping software that runs from the command prompt.  All data is stored locally.  The software can generate
invoices and accounting reports used for taxes and analysis.

## Native Build

Note: not working yet

When gradle build is run with ./gradlew nativeCompile you should get binary under build/native/nativeCompile directory.
