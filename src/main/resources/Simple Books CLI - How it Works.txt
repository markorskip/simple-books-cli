generate-auto-report
    -> select vehicle (or all)
        -> select tax year
            -> getMileageAtBegOfYear

answer-questions

    ->any answered facts are asked of the user - stuff like what is the end of year mileage for this vehicle... etc...


So the way it works:

The user just starts using the program.  If something is needed, the program asks for it. So to start logging, it's the bare mininmum questions to get started.

When reports are run, some paramaters are given each time, some are more permeant.  Facts that stick around are stored.  They can also be answered ahead of time using the answer-questions tool.


Run the program
Load your business
Log {time, money, mileage, notes}
Generate {invoice, income and expense reports, auto reports, note archives)

Initial Modules:
TimeKeeping and Invoice Generation
Bookkeeping and Report Generation
Mileage Tracking and Auto Report Generation
Note Taking and Note Reporting

Each module walks the user through adding items to always ensure they are in sync and valid for reporting. So unlike a spreadsheet, it maintains relationships between the data.  All the data is related to the business and much of it is
interrelated.

A spreadsheet cannot do this (it doesn't have a wizard for adding date)

An online program does provide guardrailes but requires a monthly subscription, learning the user interface, and manually completing all the tasks.  SimpleBooksCLI provides the guardrails of a web app, but the efficieny of using a command
